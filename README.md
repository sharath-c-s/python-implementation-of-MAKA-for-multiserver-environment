# python-implementation-of-MAKA-for-multiserver-environment
This code is a python implementation of the research paper titled "Design of Mutually Authenticated Key Agreement Protocol Resistant to Impersonation Attacks for Multi-Server Environment" by alavapati et al. We have used classes to create servers and instances of classes to act as servers and clients. The communication between server and client is mostly implemented as function calls. This project aims to show the security offered by the protocol that was mentioned in the above paper. It  can be compared to the protocol that was the base for the current protocol. Implementation code for both the protocols was provided.
